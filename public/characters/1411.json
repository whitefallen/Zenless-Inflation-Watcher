Aside from being part of the Inter-Knot subforum Spook Shack, she's not affiliated with any other groups — though in New Eridu, such forums aren't typically seen as formal organizations, and are, instead, more like hobby clubs.\nYuzuha is the adopted daughter of Li Baorong, owner of the Mystic Wares Porcelume store. Word around Failume Heights is that Baorong lost his wife and two daughters when the old capital fell. In the years that followed, he took in five children. Yuzuha is the second oldest, with an older brother, a younger brother, and two younger sisters. The family lived on the second floor above the store, and with just two bedrooms, Yuzuha shared one with her sisters, while the boys stayed with Baorong. Now that her older brother has moved out and she mostly stays in the school dorm, the apartment feels a bit less crowded. But on weekends and holidays, Yuzuha usually returns from school to help her father at the store.\nEven as a child, Yuzuha showed a surprising level of maturity. Her eloquence and cheerful nature have made her a favorite among neighbors — and a hit with the kids around Waifei Peninsula and Sailume Bay.\nOn the Spook Shack forum, Yuzuha goes by the username \"Yuzupepper.\" In addition to her real-life friends Manato and Alice, she is also close with two other users known as \"Night Emissary\" and \"Strawberry Parfait\" on the forums.",

Due to malnutrition, she had night blindness and always carried a candlestick after dark, so the others nicknamed her \"Little Candle.\"\nYuzuha was part of an experimental project called \"Project New Leaf.\" Since she never had a proper name, one of the lower-level researchers assigned to care for the children gave her the name \"Yuzuha.\" However, this name was never known to Ferox or the other higher-ups — they only ever referred to her as ES-07. Despite the name coming from the lab, Yuzuha has always felt the name carried a spark of life — and that spark was part of her luck.\nBoth of Yuzuha's younger sisters were adopted as infants, and when Baorong named them, he continued his tradition of using names inspired by plants.",

Sweating as they hurried across the skybridge, they passed just above a throng of reporters surrounding the guests. That's when she spotted the girl. That night, she had a dream: it was her being swarmed by reporters, walking that same path under the bridge. And at the end of it... stood a throne, waiting just for her.\nIt had been a long time since she'd had a dream like that. She got up for a drink of water, replaying the words she'd overheard during the day: \"A so-called expert Inspection Team, and they've got some rich girl tagging along just for show!\"\n\"Kama, Kama!\" She cracked open the window and whispered. A fuzzy little face popped up instantly from outside. \"I've got a great idea. Tomorrow night... let's go do something fun.\""

When using <color=#FFFFFF>Assist Follow-Up: Stuffed Hard Candy Shot</color>, hold <IconMap:Icon_Normal> to charge for up to 0.8 seconds. Releasing <IconMap:Icon_Normal> or reaching full charge fires an extra powerful shell at the enemy. For every 0.4s charged, Yuzuha consumes 1 <color=#FFFFFF>Sugar Point</color> to fire an additional powerful shell, each dealing 300% of her ATK as <color=#F0D12B>Physical DMG</color>. If any powerful shell from <color=#FFFFFF>Assist Follow-Up: Stuffed Hard Candy Shot</color> hits an enemy, all squad members' <color=#FFFFFF>Disorder</color> DMG Multiplier increases by 105% for 40s, and stacking up to 3 times, with each stack duration being calculated separately. In addition, if the powerful shell hits an enemy under <color=#FFFFFF>Sweet Scare</color>, it'll trigger 1 <color=#FFFFFF>Basic Attack: Sugarburst Sparkles - Max</color> attack. If Yuzuha is attacked while charging, she will automatically dodge the attack and immediately unleash the max-charged attack.",
      "Desc2": "The night the hearing ended, Baorong said they should celebrate Kaede getting a scholarship, so Mystic Wares closed early and the whole family went to Yum Cha Sin.\nDuring the meal, her brother called from the far-off Faunus Quarter to offer his congratulations. While Sumire and A-Wen animatedly recounted the day's events: a calico cat at school had lost her kitten, and no one could find it — until, miraculously, it came back on its own at noon.\nOn the phone, her brother sighed, \"A-Wen, every time I ask about your grades, you change the subject. If Dad and Yuzuha won't say anything, then I will!\"\nEveryone laughed — except Baorong, who just kept murmuring, \"It came back, that's what matters... that it came back...\""
