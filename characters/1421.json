Only someone who's truly known starvation understands its terror, and to fill his belly he sampled every trade he could find. In the end, his remarkable Ether aptitude led him to become a Hollow Raider.\nAs a Hollow Raider, he had a chance encounter with Yixuan. Following a harsh beating and a sudden spiritual awakening, he opted to become a disciple of Yunkui Summit, where he now practices the mystic arts to cleanse his then-increasingly violent nature.\nBecause he joined the sect later than most, he actually has very few junior disciples â€” and you, Master, are one of them. As your senior, he shows his care by cooking special dishes just for you and constantly sneaking store coupons into your pockets.",
